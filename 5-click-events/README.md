# React.js Click Event Handler

## Introduction
This repository provides a simple example of implementing click event handlers in React.js. In React, event handling is similar to handling events in HTML, but with some syntactical differences due to JSX.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-click-event-handler
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Implementation
The main component `ClickHandler` demonstrates how to handle click events in React.js:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ClickHandler() {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setClicks(clicks + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Click Event Handler Example</h1>
      <p>Number of clicks: {clicks}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ClickHandler;
