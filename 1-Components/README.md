# React Components

This repository contains a collection of React components designed to facilitate the development of user interfaces for web applications.

## What are React Components?

React components are modular, reusable building blocks used to create user interfaces in React applications. Each component encapsulates a piece of UI, including its structure, behavior, and styling.

## Types of Components

1. **Functional Components**: Simplest type of component, written as a JavaScript function.
2. **Class Components**: Components written as ES6 classes, allowing for additional features like state and lifecycle methods.
3. **Reusable Components**: Components that can be reused across different parts of an application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Using Components

1. **Importing Components**: Import components into your application using ES6 import syntax.
   ```jsx
   import { Button, Navbar } from './components';
