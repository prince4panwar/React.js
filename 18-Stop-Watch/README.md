# Stop Watch Project using React Hooks

This project demonstrates a simple stop watch implementation using ReactJS and leveraging React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.

## Overview

A stop watch is a common feature in applications that tracks the elapsed time. In this project, we've built a stop watch with the following functionalities:

- Start: Begins tracking the elapsed time.
- Pause: Pauses the elapsed time.
- Reset: Resets the elapsed time to 0.
