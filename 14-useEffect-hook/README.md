# Understanding the useEffect Hook in React

In React, `useEffect` is a built-in hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects might include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `useEffect` is to manage side effects in your components. It serves as a replacement for lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.

## Basic Syntax

The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments: a function and an optional array of dependencies.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code goes here
}, [dependencies]);
