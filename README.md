# React Overview

Welcome to the React repository! This README provides an overview of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create interactive UIs using a component-based architecture.

## Core Concepts

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using reusable components. Each component represents a piece of UI, encapsulating its own structure, behavior, and styling.

2. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM. When the state of a component changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updates the necessary parts, leading to improved performance.

3. **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to create React elements and define component structures.

4. **State and Props**: React components can have state, which represents data that can change over time. Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent to child components.

5. **Lifecycle Methods**: React components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to execute code at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as when it is created, updated, or destroyed.

6. **Hooks**: Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing class components. Hooks provide a more functional approach to managing component state and side effects.
