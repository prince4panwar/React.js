# Updating Array of Objects in React State

When working with React, you often encounter scenarios where you need to update an array of objects in the component's state. This README.md provides guidelines and examples for efficiently updating such data structures.

## Basic Concepts

In React, state should be treated as immutable. When updating an array of objects in state, you should always create a new array and object references to ensure proper rendering and state management.

## Updating Array of Objects

### 1. Using `setState()`

The `setState()` method provided by React is the recommended way to update the state. When updating an array of objects, you need to create a new array with updated objects and then set the state with this new array.

Example:

```javascript
this.setState(prevState => ({
  myArray: prevState.myArray.map(obj => obj.id === updatedObj.id ? updatedObj : obj)
}));
