# Conditional Rendering in React

Conditional rendering in React allows you to dynamically render different content or components based on certain conditions. This is a powerful feature that enables you to create more interactive and responsive user interfaces.

## Using Conditional Rendering

There are several ways to perform conditional rendering in React:

### Using if-else Statements

You can use traditional JavaScript if-else statements directly within your JSX code to conditionally render components or content.

```jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  } else {
    return <GuestGreeting />;
  }
}
